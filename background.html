  <h3><em> A little background information about me and some fun facts! </em></h3>
  <p> Hi! My name is (In-see-ya) and I was born in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. My parents are from Pakistan, but I was
  born and raised in the US. I'm not sure if any of you will be familiar with the city, but I grew up in South Barrington, IL. 
  I attended Barrington High School from 2011-2015 and then attended Indiana University-Bloomington with a major in computer
  science. I decided that was not what I wanted to do, so I decided to transfer to Harper 
  College to get my Gen Eds out of the way. After finishing 2 years, I decided to major in Information Technology and 
  Management and I could not be more happy! I chose IIT because I have always wanted to live in the city and I was not a
  fan living on a huge college campus. I am a second year student since some of the credits at Harper were not able to 
  transfer. I enjoy interacting with people and I absolutely love traveling because I am able to learn about a wide variety of 
  different cultures. Not only that, I love to help out as much as I am able to in the community. If you navigate to my 
  resume page you will be able to see some of the places I volunteer for. My favorite color is blue and my favorite shows 
  include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Black Mirror </li>
    <li> Orphan Black </li> 
    <li> How I Met Your Mother </li> 
    <li> The Office </li>
  </ul>
